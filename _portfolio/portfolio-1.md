title: "Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Excited-State Dynamics"
excerpt: "The understanding of excited state processes and material defects is a key driver of human innovation and sustainable synthesis. My research focuses on simulating ultrafast spectroscopy observables and photochemical reactions to elucidate the complex dynamics of molecules in their excited states. Additionally, I investigate the role of defects in materials to harness their unique properties for technological advancements. These efforts not only deepen our fundamental scientific knowledge but also pave the way for breakthroughs in energy efficiency, material science, and computational methodologies, driving forward innovation and sustainability. 1<br/><img src='/images/Ultrafast.png'>"
