A computational chemist advancing the frontiers of molecular and material science through cutting-edge simulations and high-performance computing. My research delves into the development of electronic structure visualization tools, quantum crystallography, simulations of ultrafast spectroscopy observables, excited-state dynamics, and the intricate photochemistry of molecular systems and quantum dots.

I earned my PhD from [Texas Christian University](https://www.tcu.edu/) in December 2020 with a dissertation titled "[A Computational Toolkit for Understanding Orbital Overlap and Chemical Reactivity](https://repository.tcu.edu/handle/116099117/42785)" supervised by [Prof. Benjamin G. Janesko](https://cse.tcu.edu/faculty-staff/view/benjamin-janesko). Subsequently, in January 2021, I joined the [research group](https://levinegroup.org/) of [Prof. Benjamin G. Levine](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/chemistry/faculty/_faculty-profiles/Levine_Benjamin) as a Postdoctoral Associate at [Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/) Department of Chemistry and the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS)](https://www.stonybrook.edu/iacs/). During my tenure, I specialized in simulating ultrafast spectroscopy observable utilizing GPU-accelerated electronic structure methods, exploring excited-state dynamics, and investigating the photochemistry of molecules and quantum dots.

I am currently working as a Senior Research Scientist in the Division of Information Technology (DoIT) - Research Computing, Informatics & Innovation, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS) at Stony Brook University.
